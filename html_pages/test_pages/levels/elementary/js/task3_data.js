    Last weekend, my family went to the countryside. We left our house early in the morning and drove for two hours. The weather was sunny and warm, perfect for a picnic. We brought sandwiches, fruit, and juice with us.
    When we arrived, we went for a walk in the forest. I saw many birds and even a fox! My little sister was very excited because she had never seen a fox before. After the walk, we sat on the grass and had lunch. The sandwiches were delicious.
    In the afternoon, we played football and flew a kite. My father took many photos. We returned home in the evening, tired but happy. It was one of the best weekends of the year.
