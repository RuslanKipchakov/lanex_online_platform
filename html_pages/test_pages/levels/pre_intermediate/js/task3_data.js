    title: "Text 1 – The Mystery of the Bees",
    passage: `
      Bees are some of the most important insects in the world. They help plants grow by moving pollen from one flower to another, a process called pollination. Without bees, many fruits and vegetables would not grow well, and humans would have less food to eat.
      In recent years, scientists have noticed a worrying problem: bee populations are getting smaller in many countries. There are several possible reasons for this. First, modern farming uses chemicals called pesticides, which can harm bees. Second, climate change is affecting the flowers that bees depend on. Finally, some diseases spread quickly among bee colonies.
      To help the bees, people are trying different solutions. Some farmers are planting more flowers near their fields. Others are avoiding harmful chemicals. In cities, more people are keeping bees on rooftops and in gardens. These small actions can make a big difference, and if we work together, we can protect these amazing insects for the future.

    title: "Text 2 – The Northern Lights",
    passage: `
      The Northern Lights, also called the Aurora Borealis, are one of the most beautiful natural displays in the world. They appear as colourful lights in the night sky, usually green, pink, or purple. The best places to see them are near the Arctic Circle, in countries like Norway, Finland, and Canada.
      The lights happen when particles from the Sun reach the Earth. These particles enter the atmosphere and hit gases like oxygen and nitrogen, which then produce light. This process is similar to how a neon sign works.
      People have been fascinated by the Northern Lights for thousands of years. In the past, some cultures believed they were messages from the gods. Today, scientists can explain them, but they are still magical to watch.
      The Northern Lights are not visible every night. You need a dark, clear sky, and the right time of year, usually winter. Even then, there is no guarantee you will see them, so many tourists spend several nights waiting for the perfect moment.
