    title: "Text – The Psychology of Decision-Making Under Uncertainty",
    passage: `
      In a world filled with constant choices—from mundane purchases to life-changing career moves—understanding how humans make decisions under uncertainty has become a central theme in psychology and behavioral economics. Unlike decisions based on certainty, where outcomes are predictable, uncertain decisions force individuals to weigh probabilities, potential risks, and emotional responses.
      A key concept in understanding this process is "heuristics"—mental shortcuts the brain uses to make quick judgments. While heuristics can be efficient, they are also prone to systematic errors or biases. For example, the availability heuristic leads individuals to overestimate the probability of events that are more memorable or emotionally charged, such as plane crashes or shark attacks. Consequently, people often make irrational decisions, not because they lack intelligence, but because their brains prioritize speed over accuracy.
      Another factor influencing decisions under uncertainty is risk aversion. Studies show that most individuals prefer a smaller but certain reward over a larger, probabilistic one. This behavior is central to prospect theory, developed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. The theory challenges the traditional economic view that humans are rational actors by demonstrating that people value losses more than equivalent gains—a phenomenon known as loss aversion.
      Interestingly, emotional states can significantly alter how we perceive risk. When anxious or stressed, individuals tend to overestimate negative outcomes and become more conservative in their choices. Conversely, a positive mood may lead to riskier decisions. Brain imaging studies support this, showing that regions associated with emotion regulation, such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, are highly active during uncertain decision-making.
      Despite the complexity of human behavior, understanding these mechanisms has practical applications. In fields such as finance, public health, and marketing, knowledge of decision-making patterns can be used to predict consumer behavior, guide public policy, or improve user experience design. For instance, nudging—a concept popularized by behavioral economist Richard Thaler—relies on subtle changes in how choices are presented to influence decisions without restricting freedom.
      In sum, decision-making under uncertainty is not simply a matter of logic and calculation. It is a deeply human process, shaped by emotions, cognitive shortcuts, and social context. By studying the hidden patterns in our behavior, researchers hope to empower people to make better choices in an increasingly complex world.
