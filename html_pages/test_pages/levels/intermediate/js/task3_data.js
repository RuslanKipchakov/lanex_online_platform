    title: "Text 1 – The Mystery of Icebergs",
    passage: `
      Icebergs are large masses of ice that have broken off from glaciers or ice shelves and float in open water. Although they appear calm and majestic, icebergs can be dangerous, especially to ships. One of the most famous iceberg-related disasters was the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.
      What makes icebergs especially interesting is how little of them is visible. In fact, only about 10% of an iceberg is above the water, while the other 90% remains hidden beneath the surface. This is why the expression “the tip of the iceberg” is used to describe a small part of a much larger issue.
      Icebergs form when chunks of freshwater ice break away from glaciers, usually in cold regions like Antarctica or Greenland. As the climate continues to change, scientists are observing more frequent iceberg calving — a process in which pieces of ice separate and float away. Some icebergs can be as large as cities and take years to melt completely.
      Despite their potential hazards, icebergs play an important role in the environment. As they melt, they release fresh water and nutrients into the ocean, which supports marine life. For scientists, studying icebergs helps them learn more about climate patterns and ocean currents.

    title: "Text 2 – Why Do We Procrastinate?",
    passage: `
      You have an important task to complete, but instead of starting it, you check your phone, make tea, or scroll through social media. This behavior is called procrastination — the act of delaying something even when you know it’s important.
      Psychologists believe procrastination is often linked to emotional regulation. We tend to avoid tasks that cause stress, boredom, or anxiety. Ironically, putting them off usually makes the situation worse.
      Another reason we procrastinate is perfectionism. If you feel your work must be flawless, you might delay starting because you’re afraid to fail. In other cases, poor time management plays a role — people underestimate how long a task will take and leave it until the last minute.
      To overcome procrastination, experts suggest breaking large tasks into smaller ones. This makes them feel more manageable. Using timers, planning your day in advance, and removing distractions can also help.
      While procrastination is common, understanding why it happens can help people make better choices — and feel less guilty about it.
